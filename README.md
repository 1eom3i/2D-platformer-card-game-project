Welcome to Card Master, a unique 2D platformer card game developed using Unity.

## Game Overview

In this game, players navigate a diverse range of levels, battling enemies, avoiding traps, and devising the best route to reach the end of each stage. The twist? All player actions are controlled through playing cards.

Players are equipped with a hand of 5 cards. They can either play a single card to perform an action or play multiple cards in a combo to achieve more impressive results. Whether it's running forward or backward, jumping, or attacking, every movement is dictated by the cards you play.

The game consists of five engaging levels, each offering a distinctive challenge and requiring strategic card-play to progress.
